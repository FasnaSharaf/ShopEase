<b>(Project...By FasnaSharaf, sreelakshmisatheesh, anna-197, Fathimaa-7 )</b>
## PROBLEM STATEMENT

“ India has the highest shop density in the world and about 70 million small merchants who collectively control almost 90% of India's retail trade “ ie, we are encircled by many different small-scale retailers but frequently depending on giant-scale markets can diminish the upliftment of poorer sectioned merchants and increase the rich-poor gap. 

Secondly, it is an age of instant gratification, where everyone expects everything to be available instantly right away. As a society, we live fast-paced lives, eat fast food, use high-speed internet, and lead fast-paced lifestyles. We do not have the patience to pick up these types of everyday necessities since we are unaware of when and where they will be available. Eg)If a person needs a commodity urgently at midnight say, 11.30 pm, he will randomly move to some stores without knowing whether that store is open or not. 


Last but not least, there are times when we need a bulk of a commodity, say 15 packets of biscuits. Instead of traveling to a supermarket that is possibly distant from where we are, there is a chance to find a large quantity at neighboring stores that we are not aware of.

## SOLUTION
We introduce <b>"ShopEase", “AN ONLINE PLATFORM THAT PROVIDES LIVE COUNT AND BRAND DETAILS OF EACH ITEM IN THE STORE THAT IS VISIBLE TO BOTH USERS AND SHOPKEEPERS”</b> This helps common people to choose the best store with the required quantity near to them. Additionally, shop owners will get a live idea about which item is liked and brought by the customer most which enhances promoting the best quality product in the market. So the shop owners can accordingly take the quantity of most spent items within a short span of time.

## WORKING
<b>PHASE 1</b>= Users can enter the desired location and essential things they want to buy. The platform will display nearby stores that contain the required commodity and display the live count of that commodity in that particular store. For example, Mr. X requires 2  bread packets at 11.00 pm-midnight. He doesn't know which shops will be open around that time and if some shops are open, he has no idea if the required food will be there or not. He, therefore, enters this platform after giving the location and finds a nearby store, say S1,  within 3 km that contains 5 packets of bread. He can now directly go and buy the same without any rush and thereby reducing fuel consumption and accidents at night. He too can avoid a random selection of stores under simple guesses.

<b>PHASE 2</b>= The count of commodities will be directly updated in the database(liver server) once the digital payment is done. This helps other users to see the live update in the number of items. For example, 2 packets from 5 packets of bread are taken by Mr. X earlier from S1. Suppose the next user, say, Mr. Y, comes into the picture, and the quantity visible in the user interface of Mr. Y  is 3 after the billing is done by Mr. X. This gives an idea about what all items the store is famous for, thereby knowing good products under different brands of the same category. 

<b>PHASE 3</b>= Shop owners will get a chance to realize the best product in the market after analyzing the needs of each customer based on the decrement of the product in the live server. Even though this increases competition among different retailers in the market, thereby ensuring the best product stands out in the market among others. Moreover, every shop will be constantly filling up the items to beat the competitive nature of nearby stores.

## KEY FEATURES 

### 1. Business model

The business model is based on a commission system. The platform charges a small percentage of the transaction value as a commission from the shop owners for using the platform after a free trial period.
It may also generate revenue through advertisements on the website.


### 2. Provision for buying items via or by direct purchase 

The platform provides a provision to buy items through the app and collect the items they bought later from the shop using a pass key generated after making the transaction.

The platform also provides an option for shop owners to update their inventory manually in case of any direct sales made offline through a simple and user-friendly interface that allows shop owners to update their inventory easily. The interface can be designed to be intuitive, and the platform can provide tutorials and training sessions to help shop owners understand how to use it efficiently. Additionally, the platform can offer incentives such as increased visibility for shops with higher accuracy in inventory updates to encourage more shop owners to use the platform.

### 3. Allowing customers to make purchases on credit and pay later only at the discretion of the shopkeeper

We understand that many customers often buy from shopkeepers on credit and sometimes these transactions can be forgotten, leading to a loss for shopkeepers. To address this issue, our platform will include a provision to make purchases that allow shopkeepers to keep track of credit transactions made by their customers. This will help shopkeepers manage their finances better and reduce the risk of losses due to forgotten transactions. This feature will also provide reminders to customers to ensure timely payment of their debts.

### 4. Avoids data accuracy issues

The platform provides various measures to ensure data accuracy, such as providing real-time inventory updates, sending alerts to shop owners to update their inventory, and implementing an automated verification system to flag discrepancies in the data. The platform can also provide a feedback mechanism for customers to report any inaccuracies they encounter, allowing the platform to take corrective action quickly.

### 5. Customer reviews and ratings

Including customer reviews and ratings help users make more informed decisions about which shop to choose. This could be achieved by allowing customers to leave feedback and ratings after they make a purchase.

### 6. Loyalty program

Creating a loyalty program could incentivize customers to use the platform more often and build a stronger relationship with the platform. This could be achieved by offering rewards for frequent purchases or providing special discounts to loyal customers.

### 7. Gamification

Adding a gamification element to the platform could help make it more engaging and entertaining for users. This could be achieved by adding challenges, rewards, and leaderboards for users who use the platform frequently or make purchases regularly.

## SOCIAL IMPACT
We know India has the highest shop density in the world. We can see a lot of small shop clusters in India. This shows that there is a huge section in our society who meet their daily needs using the small profit they gained from their small business. Most of them may not even have savings. But at the same time, we can also see a lot of very big successful shops of wealthy people who sell the same quality commodities that the small-scale retailers sell but many people prefer to buy from them may be because he/she is unaware of such quality commodities that exist nearby. While doing so, the rich get richer, the poor mostly stay poor and the gap widens. So we aim to uplift poorer sections in a developing country like INDIA and narrow the rich-poor gap. This platform also helps small retailers to get an overall idea of how large-scale retailers run their business and realize the trending products under each category with a single click on their smartphones.
